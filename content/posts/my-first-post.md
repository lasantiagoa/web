Hello! I'm thrilled to have you here.

### Who Am I?

My name is **Luis A. Santiago**, and I am a Dominican software engineer, entrepreneur, and innovation expert. With over 20 years of experience in software development, innovation, consulting, and more, I have dedicated my career to helping entrepreneurs and organizations create better futures, *one micro-sprint at a time*.

I am the author of the [MicroCanvas Framework (MCF) 2.0](https://themicrocanvas.com), an open-source innovation framework that proposes *better ways* of creating and transforming organizations. I'm also the author of an upcoming guide titled: **"The Innovation Lab: A guide to accelerate global innovation"**.

Currently, I am the Head Coach at [Doulab](https://doulab.net), an innovation lab that aims to *accelerate entrepreneurship by empowering the next billion entrepreneurs to create sustainable, exponentially accelerated organizations that deliver meaningful change*. 

My experiences include working as an innovation coach for [Alpha Valores](https://alpha.com.do), [FUNDAPEC](https://fundapec.edu.do), [AFP SIEMBRA](https://afpsiembra.com), [Caudall](https://caudall.com), [Nelmix](https://nelmix.com.do), [C-VEN Technologies](https://c-ven.com), as well as serving as an advisor for [Alo Salu](https://alosalu.com). Additionally, I am an alumnus of [Singularity University](https://su.org) ([GSP 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpEvq6qE31w)) and also served there as an Entrepreneur In Residence in Mountain View - 2018, [Denmark - 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auk-N_Qh44A)).

In the past, I've also lead two software development organizations that have failed and, with it, contributed to my current path as an innovation coach.
